# 2D16BitStylizedRPG
This repository holds the source code for a 2D 16bit stylized Role Playing Game. This project is to eventually hold the source code
of a future summer project of a small, lightweight, but fun and expressive game. My hope is to have to game be available to play
and modify for all for anyone's future enjoyment. The final purpose of this project is to show what kind of software I am capable of 
creating for future employers while also creating a piece of software as a creative passion.

## TODO
Literally everything...
